# Traffic Model Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

### Description:
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to classify traffic signs and predict the type of traffic signs in images. It is a deep learning-based solution that leverages CNNs' ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features to detect, recognize, and classify various traffic signs.

### Key Features:
- **Traffic Sign Classification**: The model takes images of traffic signs and classifies them into various categories (e.g., stop signs, speed limits, etc.).
- **Deep Learning Approach**: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for robust image classification.


### Dataset:
- The dataset used consists of labeled traffic sign images, which are categorized into different classes based on their meaning.
- Common datasets used for such tasks include the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** or similar traffic sign datasets

This project is part of my continuous learning journey in the world of deep learning and computer vision. Looking forward to exploring more innovative applications in the future!
