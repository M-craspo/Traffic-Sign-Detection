# Traffic Model Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

### Description:
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to classify traffic signs and predict the type of traffic signs in images. It is a deep learning-based solution that leverages CNNs' ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features to detect, recognize, and classify various traffic signs.

### Key Features:
- **Traffic Sign Classification**: The model takes images of traffic signs and classifies them into various categories (e.g., stop signs, speed limits, etc.).
- **Deep Learning Approach**: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for robust image classification.
- **Transfer Learning (optional)**: Can include pre-trained models to fine-tune the classification task for better accuracy.

### Dataset:
- The dataset used consists of labeled traffic sign images, which are categorized into different classes based on their meaning.
- Common datasets used for such tasks include the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** or similar traffic sign datasets
